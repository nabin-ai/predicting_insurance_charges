# Project Overview

This project contains the following files:

1. **notebook.ipynb** - A Jupyter Notebook that contains data analysis, visualization, and linear regression model.
2. **insurance.csv** - A dataset that contains information about insurance charges.
3. **validation_dataset.csv** - A dataset that contains information for validation.
   
## Requirements
